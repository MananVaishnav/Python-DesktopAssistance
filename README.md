# Desktop-Voice-Assistance-using-Python
A Voice assistant is a user interface that takes the voice commands from the user and does the corresponding task. The task might be responding to the queries, connecting to the device, and doing the work specified by the user like opening google, open youtube, get current location etc. Here, we will be making such a system using Python.

# objectives
Desktop Voice Assistance, also called digital assistance, is a program/application that understands natural language voice  commands and completes task for the user. This Assistance provides an eminent control over all applications and software installed on the computer and automates all the required task through voice on a single go.

# System Architecture
This Assistant consists of three modules. First is, assistant accepting voice input from user. Secondly, analyzing the input given by the user, and mapping it to the respective intent and function. And the third is, the assistant giving user the result all along with voice.

# Limitations
The virtual assistant didn't always understand what we were saying. This is due to a variety of factors. It could be because of the way we speak, or because of our accent. It's possible that the assistant didn't know what to do with your inquiry.

# Required Modules
1. Pyttsx3
2. Speech Recognition
3. Pyaudio
4. OS
5. Wikipedia
6. Datetime
7. PyQt5 for UI

# Summary
The virtual assistants which are currently available are fast and responsive but we still have to go a long way. The understanding and reliability of the current systems need to be improved a lot. The assistants available nowadays are still not reliable in critical scenarios. The future of these assistants will have the virtual assistants incorporated with Artificial Intelligence which includes Machine Learning, Neural Networks, etc. and IoT.
